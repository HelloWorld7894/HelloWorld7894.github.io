                <h2>TV@J 2022</h2>
                <p>An event organized by <b>Faculty of Nuclear Sciences and Physical Engineering</b>
                    for highschool students, with a lot of presentations about nuclear engineering and mathematics.
                    There was an assigment for every student, to make a presentation about a topic they researched over
                    whole week, for example me and my team had presentation about Computer Algebra Systems (CAS)
                    like Wolfram Mathematica, etc.Then we had to present it and make a research paper on this topic.
                </p>

                <h2>AIMTEC Hackathon 2022</h2>
                <p>An event organized by <b>AIMTEC</b>, a tech company operating here in Pilsen. Theme of this Hackathon
                    was about automation and we had about 40 hours to make it. So one member of the theam came up with an idea to make new input device for
                    computer... <b>a flute!</b>. At first i wasnt really excited about that idea, i wanted to make it more
                    serious, but after countdown started i was starting to get excited about this project, and went to
                    endlessly work on it for 36 hours! (Ofc i needed a lot of sleep after). We won <b>1st</b>  place in
                    community voting and <b>2nd</b> place in voting of the judges.

                <h2>Campo Lampone 2020->now</h2>
                <p>
                    A cybernetic themed camp for advanced programmers (mostly IoT, Computer Vision and Neural Networks), those programmers are grouped into teams
                    that are working on solution to a specific problem. This event is hosted by the Department of Cybernetics
                    on Faculty of Applied Sciences

                <h2>Campo Arduino 2018->2021</h2>
                <p>
                    A cybernetic themed camp for beginner and intermediate programmers who try to code mBot for specific tasks
                    (beginner -> <b>scratch</b>, intermediate -> <b>C programming language</b>), again, programmers are put into teams
                    and try to compete with other teams (this camp is more competetive than Campo Lampone, because Campo Lampone is more
                    about solving the problem)

                <h2>UkliďmePlzeň 2022</h2>
                <p>
                    A project aiming to clean our city. Around 180 students participated in 12 districts and we managed to collect 1,8 tons of garbage!
                    I was a group leader in one of these districts.

                <h2>Plnoc 2022</h2>
                <p>
                    An event about students giving lectures to other students about the topic they are interested in.
                    I registered a lecture about Computer Vision and Neural networks, where i explained image segmentation,
                    convolution algorithms, convolutional neural networks, generative adversarial networks, etc.
