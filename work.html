                <p>
                    A project from a student of my highschool, in which i am currently developing whole website and app.
                    This project is aiming to clean our city by organising city cleaning every year.
                    First cleaning happened in 2022, in which 180 students from our city were distributed around 12 districts,
                    i was leader in one of them. This project was huge success, we gathered about 3,7 tons of garbage.

                    In year 2019 I joined our highschool newspapers, I have written couple of interesting Articles
                    and I will probably still continue in writing about different topics

                <p>
                    In year 2022 the Editor in Chief has left his post, so I thought it would be great idea to
                    get into the lead of our newspapers, to improve its reputation around school, find much cheaper hosting, etc.
