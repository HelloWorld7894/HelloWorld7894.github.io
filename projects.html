                <h2>SumoPi (2021->2022)</h2>
                <p>Competition organised by Department of cybernetics of the Faculty of Applied Sciences.
                    This competition was about building the best sumo robot. I was planning to make it actually
                    intelligent, so I started working on raspberry pi 4B with camera, 1 ToF sensor, Accelerometer
                    and 2 line sensors. It was more like a State-of-art to prove the concept of using the Camera in a sumo robot, because i was
                    the only one who was making sumo robot with camera in that competition.
                    Conclusion: I managed to actually prove some efficiency with the camera, because the robot was able to efficiently detect
                    white bounding lines of sumo field. Unfortunately, I did not have a time to tweak that code for better than State-of-art
                    results.

                <h2>Dronogeddon (2022->now)</h2>
                <p>This is the project from G+SOÅ  hackathon, because after the hackathon has finished, 
                    me and my team thought it would be nice to continue working on this interesting project.
                    Basically, we are trying to code a drone which will fly in a house and predict human by camera, to find an 
                    intruder. This problematic was introduced to us in the hackathon, so we have only State-of-art results, 
                    but we are trying to find funding to buy programmable drone with more sensors to release better versions of
                    Dronogeddon.
