                <h2>SumoPi (2021->2022)</h2>
                <p>Competition organised by Department of cybernetics of the Faculty of Applied Sciences.
                    This competition was about building the best sumo robot. I was planning to make actually
                    intelligent, so I started working on raspberry pi 4B with camera, 1 ToF sensor, Accelerometer (that i havent used)
                    and 2 line sensors. It wasnt really as good idea as i thought, and even worse idea is try to embed
                    this code in python. Conclusion: Even though because of camera, robot was much more accurate in finding enemy,
                    but it has around 1 second delay, which is quite unacceptable, so I am probably going abandon using camera,
                    and make it more efficient without camera. Anyways, the Robot sumo competition redirected those 3 teams left
                    on robotic days in Prague, so we will see about the competition.
